# Resume Improvement Suggestions Feature

## ✅ Implementation Complete

The **Resume Improvement Suggestions** feature has been successfully integrated into your resume screener app!

## 🧩 Feature Overview

After a resume is uploaded and analyzed, the system automatically generates **personalized improvement tips** that appear below the match score in a visually distinct section.

## ⚙️ How It Works

### 1. Analysis Criteria

The system analyzes each resume for:

- **Contact Info** - Email and phone number
- **Skills Section** - Explicit "Skills" or "Technical Skills" heading
- **Action Verbs** - Strong verbs like "developed", "implemented", "improved"
- **Quantified Achievements** - Metrics and percentages
- **Education/Certifications** - Degrees and relevant courses
- **ATS Keywords** - Technical skills matching the job description
- **Formatting** - Bullet points, structure, readability

### 2. Scoring System (0-100)

- **85-100**: Low priority (green) - Strong resume with minor improvements
- **70-84**: Medium priority (yellow) - Good foundation, some improvements needed
- **50-69**: High priority (orange) - Significant improvements required
- **0-49**: Critical priority (red) - Major revisions needed

### 3. Example Suggestions

```json
{
  "summary": "Good resume foundation with 4 improvements recommended",
  "suggestions": [
    "Add your email or phone number at the top",
    "Include technical keywords like TypeScript, GraphQL, AWS",
    "Add 1-2 quantified results in your projects (e.g., 'Improved performance by 30%')",
    "Add a 'Certifications' section with relevant courses (e.g., IBM Full Stack, Google Cybersecurity)",
    "Keep sentences short and use bullet points for clarity"
  ],
  "priority": "medium",
  "score": 72
}
```
